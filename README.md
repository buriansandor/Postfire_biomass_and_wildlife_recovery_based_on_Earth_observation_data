# Postfire biomass and wildlife recovery based on Earth observation data

Bushfires represent a persistent threat to Mediterranean ecosystems, with Greece
being one of the most affected regions in Europe. The frequency and intensity of
wildfires in Greek national reserves have prompted urgent research into their long-term effects on forest recovery and the broader ecological impacts. Rapid loss of
biomass and habitat fragmentation not only delay forest regrowth but also disrupt
animal territories, sometimes resulting in significant population declines and altered
migration patterns. Despite growing interest, quantitative models capturing the
interplay between fire-induced biomass loss, regeneration processes, and
consequences for wildlife remain underdeveloped.
This case study addresses the critical question: How do Greek national reserves
recover after bushfires, and what is the relationship between post-fire forest recovery
and changes in animal territories and populations? Leveraging multiple Earth
observation platforms—including satellite-derived vegetation indices, biomass
assessments, and high-resolution optical imagery—we evaluate the accuracy of
different data types in monitoring post-fire biomass recovery. Shapefiles of protected
area boundaries and known animal habitats are integrated to precisely assess the
spatial extent and ecological ramifications of recent fires.
Drawing on the Greek context as a detailed case study, we develop a framework
designed to evaluate general forest recovery within a time frame and analyse the
correlation between fire events and animal territory loss. The model, rooted in
Geospatial analytics is then adapted to explore its broader applicability in diverse
biomes worldwide, offering a scalable approach for post-fire ecological assessment
and conservation planning.
